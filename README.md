# nixos-config

This repo contains my NixOS config I use on my home machine.

## Usage

```sh
# There is a flake present for running nixfmt as a pre-commit hook, to set it up run
nix develop
```

TODO:
- Add commands how to properly clone and setup on new machine
- Add docs on what are the extra commands needed to run to setup new machine
